Next versions :
i want to add functions for making Dump files for Infected process and making text report files
and i want to add Network Monitor for this tool with API ;)
i have idea about make service for this tool with IPS Mode [on] in future.
this code from version 1.0 until version 1.0.0.5 had a bug for Detecting "Threads Injection" , 
for example when attacker try to migrat from backdoor to another process like firefox or putty or lsass this code can't detect this
migration very well , i hope fix this bug in next version very soon ;)


Note: sometimes this application detect itself like a backdoor , because in Source code this application try to scanning itself too 
you can fix that in C# Source Code for avoid itself scanning . (not recommended)
because this application detecting meterpreter signature bytes in itself memory too. (don't worry its ok) ;-)


Test:
I tested this tool by my own Encrypted Backdoor "C#" and Metasploit and Powershell Backdoors by SET tool.
Armitage not tested , i think you can detect Armitage backdoors with this tool.
Cobaltstrike not tested .
Empire not detected Unfortunately ;) maybe fortunately , because emipre native payloads was different with signature in this tool.  

-------------------
version 1.0.0.5
1.fixing huge Usage Memory in version (1.0.0.4) by SetProcessWorkingSetSize Method and GC and avoiding exception in threads 
2.this code is faster than Previous version like (1.0.0.4)
3.finally all error output colors changed also show them with time

Note:this code from version 1.0 until version 1.0.0.5 had a bug for Detecting "Threads Injection" , 
for example when attacker try to migrat from backdoor to another process like firefox or putty or lsass this code can't detect this
migration very well , i hope fix this bug in next version very soon ;)

version 1.0.0.4
1.Adding "New Process Event" for Monitoring like Realtime Mode
2.you should runAs Administrator this version because Method for Monitoring Realtime Process need to Administrator Privilege 

version 1.0.0.3
1.Adding Debug Mode [on] : Showing Hex for infected Process memory (by default)
  
version 1.0.0.2
1.Adding IPS Mode [on] Switch , using "TerminateThread" function for Killing Infected Thread for Infected Process 
with Startaddress ="0" , this code should be change in future because this code always killing Threads
with Startaddress = 0  only
Note : Powershell payloads by Social Engineer Toolkit SET always use Startaddress 0 for their Backdoor Threads
RunAs Administrator :  C:\> Meterpreter_Payload_Detection.exe IPS
