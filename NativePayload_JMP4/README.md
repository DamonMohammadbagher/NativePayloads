# NativePayload_JMP4

in C# you can use Emit(Opcodes.jmp,TargetMethod) in your codes without writing any asm bytes in code to jump to pointer of TargetMethod or (MethodInfo) to run in-memory via Emit(Opcodes.jmp, method) in system.reflection namespace ;D
yeah you can use this technique to create your own Jump code without write any assembly code in source code ;p lol , "so in this case Csharp Method name [ExecuteInMemory] indirectly called in-memory via jump method without calling c# Method in source code" , i talked about this in my ebook "Bypassing Anti-viruses by C# Programming v2.0" in chapter 3.4 and now you can see source code ;)
